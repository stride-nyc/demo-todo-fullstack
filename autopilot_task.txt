  "User Story": "As a user, I want validation when inputting todo items, so that I don't have blank items in my list.",
  "Acceptance Criteria": [
    "The 'Add Todo' button is disabled when the input field is empty. This ensures no blank todo items can be added.",
    "When the input field is empty and the user attempts to submit a todo item, a visual feedback (e.g., a red border around the input field or a warning message below the input field) is displayed to indicate that the input cannot be blank.",
    "The visual feedback disappears when the user starts typing in the input field.",
    "The 'Add Todo' button becomes enabled as soon as there is at least one character in the input field.",
    "Integration tests are updated to include a test case for attempting to add a blank todo item, ensuring the button is disabled and the appropriate feedback is displayed.",
    "Integration tests are updated to include a test case for adding a non-blank todo item after previously attempting to add a blank one, ensuring the process works as expected without interference from the validation."
  ],
  "Technical Notes": [
    "Implement state management for the input field and 'Add Todo' button enabled/disabled status within the `App` component.",
    "Use conditional rendering in React to apply different CSS classes or elements based on the input field's state to provide visual feedback.",
    "Update the `handleAddTodo` function to prevent form submission when the input field is empty.",
    "Ensure accessibility by adding appropriate ARIA attributes for the validation feedback.",
    "Update the existing test case in the provided test file to include scenarios for validation feedback and button disabled/enabled state.",
    "Consider using TailwindCSS's utility classes for styling the validation feedback to maintain consistency with the existing styling approach."
